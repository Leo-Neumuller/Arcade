# Project Arcade
### By Léo Neumuller, Jérémie Germond and Marine Poteau

**The goal of this project :**

Arcade is a gaming platform: a program that lets the user choose a game to play and keeps a register of player scores.

To be able to deal with the elements of your gaming plateform at run-time, your graphics libraries and your games must be implemented as dynamic libraries, loaded at run-time.
